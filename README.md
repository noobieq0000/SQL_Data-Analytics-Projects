# Background
The motivation behind this project stemmed from my desire to enhance my SQL fundamentals and database skills while gaining a deeper understanding of the data engineering job landscape in Japan and Singapore. My goal was to identify which skills offer both high compensation and demand, making my job search more focused and informed.

The data for this analysis is from Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). The data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skillset. 

Questions behind the project to answer through my SQL queries were: 
1. What are the highest-paying data engineer jobs? 
2. What are the required skills for top-paying data engineer jobs?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for data engineer?
4. What are the lowest paying job based on skills?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
To deep dive into the data engineering job market, I have harnessed the power of several key tools: 
- **SQL**: Backbone of my analysis allowing me to query the database and extract insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen database management system for heandling job posting data. 
- **Visual Studio Code**: For database management and executing SQL queries. 
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis for collaboration and project tracking. 

# Analysis

    INNER JOIN
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Engineer' AND
    job_postings_fact.job_location IN ('Singapore', 'Japan') 
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY
    job_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### 4. Lowest Paying Job in Data Engineering
Exploring average salaries associated with different skills revealing which skills are the lowest paying.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary -- Round to nearest integer
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Engineer' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND 
    job_postings_fact.job_location IN ('Singapore', 'Japan')
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25
```
Here is the breakdown of the results for lowest paying skills for Data Engineer: 
- High Supply, Lower Pay: **SQL/Python** are foundational and widely known; the lower average salaries reflect market saturation rather than low importance which they are essential but commoditized skills in the job market. 
- General-purpose Tools vs. Specialized Platforms: **Airflow/Unix** skillset are crucial for data pipeline management and deployment but they are treated as supporting tools rather than core differentiators leading to lower salary influence.
