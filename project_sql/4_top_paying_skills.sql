Hereâ€™s a concise summary in 3 bullet points:
- Cloud-native tools like Aurora, BigQuery, and DynamoDB offer the highest salaries, reflecting strong demand for specialized cloud skills.
- Data visualization and scripting tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Pandas, Terraform) are surprisingly lucrative, showing value in end-to-end data handling.
- Core skills like SQL, Python, and Java, while essential, command slightly lower salaries due to widespread availability.
